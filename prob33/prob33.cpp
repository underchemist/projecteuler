/*The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician
in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which
is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s. We shall consider fractions
like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples. There are exactly four non-trivial
examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two
digits in the numerator and denominator. If the product of these four
fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the
denominator.*/
